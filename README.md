## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on setting up a **virtual cybersecurity and penetration-testing laboratory** using VirtualBox and Kali Linux.

The purpose of the lab is to create a controlled environment where cybersecurity tools, network scanning, reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and other security-testing activities can be performed safely and repeatedly.

The lab is configured on a private virtual network so that additional machines can be added later and used as targets for authorized security testing.

---


## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Install and configure VirtualBox.
- Install/import Kali Linux as a virtual machine.
- Create a private **NAT Network** for the cybersecurity lab.
- Configure network connectivity for Kali Linux.
- Assign a consistent IP address to the Kali VM.
- Verify network connectivity and DNS resolution.
- Take a clean VM snapshot for recovery.
- Document the complete setup process.
- Prepare the environment for future cybersecurity projects.

---

## 🛡️ Purpose of the Lab

The lab provides an isolated and controlled environment for cybersecurity learning and authorized security testing.

It can be used for activities such as:

- Network reconnaissance
- Port scanning
- Vulnerability assessment
- Packet analysis
- Web security testing
- Exploitation practice
- Security-tool experimentation

⚠️ **Important:** This laboratory must only be used for systems that you own or have explicit permission to test. Do not use the lab or its tools to attack unauthorized systems.

# 🪜 Lab Setup Procedure

## Step 1. Install 7-Zip

7-Zip was installed to extract the Kali Linux virtual-machine package, which may be distributed as a `.7z` archive.

**Tool:** 7-Zip

![](01_install_7-zip.png)

---

## Step 2. Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox was installed as the hypervisor.

![](02_install-virtualbox.png)

---

## Step 3. Create the NAT Network

A dedicated NAT Network was created in VirtualBox.

Configuration:
Network Name: NatNetwork
IPv4 Prefix:  10.0.0.0/24
DHCP:         Enabled
IPv6:         Disabled

![](03_create_the_NAT_network.png)

A **NAT Network** was selected because multiple virtual machines connected to the same NAT Network can communicate with one another while also having outbound network connectivity.

This will allow future attacker and target VMs to communicate within the lab.


---

## Step 4. Import Kali Linux

The Kali Linux virtual machine was downloaded from the official Kali Linux website and imported into VirtualBox.

![](04_add_kali_vm.png)

The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

```text
Adapter 1
Attached to: NAT Network
Network:     NatNetwork
Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
```

![](05_configure_kali_network_settings.png)

The VM was allocated:

```text
RAM: 2048 MB
Processors: 2
Video Memory: 128 MB
```
The VM was booted to the desktop screen

![](06_kali_desktop.png)

A shared folder was also configured for transferring required files between the host operating system and the Kali VM.

![](07_shared_folder_creation.png)

---

## Step 5. Configure the Kali Linux Network

The Kali Linux network configuration was checked and configured with a consistent IPv4 address.

Example configuration:

```text
IP Address: 10.0.0.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 10.0.0.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
```

A consistent IP address makes it easier to document the lab and reference the Kali machine in future exercises.

![](08_kali_OS_network_settings.png)

The network configuration was confirmed via the Terminal.

![](09_kali_network_test_1.png) ![](10_kali_network_test_2.png)

Network connectivity proved dysfunctional after ping test and browser test, so I applied the configuration to ignore duplicate addresses.

![](11_network_dysfunction_1.png)

![](12_network_dysfunction_2.png)

I restarted the Kali VM to complete the application of the configuration.

![](13_kali_restart.png)

After restarting the VM, the network ping test and browser test proved successful

![](14_successful_ping_test.png)

![](15_successful_browser_test.png)

I shut down the machine after the primary configurations were done.

![](16_shut_down.png)

---

## Step 6. Create a Clean VM Snapshot

After completing the initial configuration, a VirtualBox snapshot was created.

Snapshot name:

```text
Freshly Configured Kali Snapshot
```

![](17_kali_snapshot_config.png)

![](18_kali_snapshot_done.png)

The snapshot represents the clean baseline of the laboratory.

If a future exercise changes or damages the VM configuration, the machine can be restored to this baseline.

```

# 🐞 Problems Encountered & Solutions

Documenting problems is an important part of the project.

## Problem 1. Internet Connectivity After Static IP Configuration

After manually configuring the IPv4 settings, Internet connectivity failed.

The solution was to apply the following commands:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dad-timeout 0

sudo nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1"

sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
```

The network connection was then restarted and connectivity was tested again.

The test failed, so the Kali VM was rebooted. The connection proved successful this time.

# 💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to create and configure a virtual environment for cybersecurity practice.

The most important concepts I learned include:

### 1. NAT vs NAT Network

A standard NAT configuration and a NAT Network serve different purposes.

A NAT Network allows multiple VMs connected to the same virtual network to communicate with one another while providing network address translation for external connectivity.

This makes it useful for building a multi-machine virtual cybersecurity laboratory.

### 2. Virtual Machine Networking

I learned how VirtualBox virtual network adapters connect virtual machines to different types of networks and how network configuration affects communication between machines.

### 3. Static IP Configuration

I learned how to configure and verify IPv4 addressing, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS settings in Kali Linux.

### 4. VM Snapshots

I learned that a clean snapshot should be created **before performing risky or experimental activities**.

This provides a known-good recovery point for future cybersecurity exercises.

### 5. Duplicate Address Detection Bypass

I learned to bypass duplicate address detection **before performing risky or experimental activities**.

This is useful when trying to establish network uptime for VMs that may have IP clashes with other VMs (which may be turned off at the time).

### 6. Documentation

I learned that documenting commands, configuration, screenshots, problems, and solutions is an important part of a professional cybersecurity project.
